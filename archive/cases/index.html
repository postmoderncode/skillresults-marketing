                    <p>The following are example industry use cases where SkillResults solves organizational problems</p>
                    
                    <div style="clear:both; height:40px;"></div>
                    
                    <img src="/img/icon_case_education.png" alt="Education Use Case" style="height:50px;vertical-align:middle;"/>
                    <span style="font-size:24px;color:#000;">&nbsp;<strong>CASE #1</strong></span>
                    <p><strong>Private Institution of Higher Learning</strong> with an extensive online adult-education program and currently contracts over 1000 adjunct instructors. It has a difficult time keeping track of who is both credentialed and qualified to teach various courses, as well as keeping records of who has completed required training for their LMS (Learning Management System) and other internal systems and policies.

                    <p>Using SkillResults, the university has an easy to access and manage skill matrix of all of their available adjuncts. They have even expanded use to full-time faculty for tenure and promotion, as well as staff to help establish development plans and annual review.</p>
                    
                    <div style="clear:both; height:40px;"></div>

                    <img src="/img/icon_case_business.png" alt="Business Use Case" style="height:50px;vertical-align:middle;"/>
                    <span style="font-size:24px;color:#000;">&nbsp;<strong>CASE #2</strong></span>
                    <p><strong>Diverse Business Operation</strong> has implemented a new strategic initiative to take inventory of in house talent, forecast needed skills for future business roles, and implement employee training and development plans including online coursework, and cross-disciplinary teams. </p>

                    <p>With SkillResults they easily delegated capturing and populating this data right to the employees. It cost them zero headaches or favors from IT as secure login links to the cloud system are delivered to their work inbox on demand. Now they can easily run reports on who knows what, what their organizational skill concentrations and weak areas are, desired skill improvement from the employees, and build strong teams with the right mix of talent to succeed while cross-training.</p>

                    <p>Employee development plans are now a breeze with skills, proficiencies, and desired improvement areas clearly spelled out right from the source. Purchasing online training for skill development have become a targeted science instead of throwing money at the wall and hoping something sticks, and the positive results of increased communication personal relationship with the workforce really shows.</p>
                    
                    <div style="clear:both; height:40px;"></div>

                    <img src="/img/icon_case_healthcare.png" alt="Healthcare Use Case" style="height:50px;vertical-align:middle;"/>
                    <span style="font-size:24px;color:#000;">&nbsp;<strong>CASE #3</strong></span>
                    <p><strong>Regional Health Care Center</strong> has a tough time keeping up with the specialties, skill training, and certifications of the healthcare professionals in its many departments. At any given time the information needed is in a manila folder somewhere, or maybe in the EHR system. Likely impossible to find or use in any meaningful way if so. Come to think of it, who’s on staff that’s really good with the EHR? Is there someplace to look for that? Most of the knowledge of various skills and proficiencies reside only with the staff themselves, with no means of organization.</p> 

                    <p>Trouble with a stick, don’t want to run a PICC, and not sure who’s the best at phlebotomy that’s on right now? Unsure whose renewable certs are expired or coming due? What was their degree and specialty again? Answering these questions went from long-term projects to a button click. SkillResults is open on a tab at just about every station because it’s so useful to quickly have talent on tap.</p> 

                    <div style="clear:both; height:40px;"></div>
                    
                    <img src="/img/icon_case_freight.png" alt="Freight Use Case" style="height:50px;vertical-align:middle;"/>
                    <span style="font-size:24px;color:#000;">&nbsp;<strong>CASE #4</strong></span>
                    <p><strong>LTL Freight Company</strong> has grown from a small family-owned operation to a large regional transportation company with terminal full of load planners, driver managers, recruiters, compliance, and everything in-between. While new contracts bring new growth, but it has been increasingly difficult to keep up with who knows or is certified/licensed for what, and when it is time for update or renewal. There’s plenty of room for both uptraining and cross-training as well, but knowing where to get started is enough to toss it into the "eventually" pile.</p>

                    <p>Enter SkillResults and suddenly ISO quality is simplified, recruiting is using it to share skills and increase numbers, driver managers can rate and improve their performance, and it’s even become easier to pick people out for job fairs and trade shows. Not only can employees gauge the critical and supporting skills for their area, there is also transparency as to what makes other departments successful. Not to mention HR loves how useful it is for evaluation and improvement planning, or how job postings have become an export button.</p>

                    <div style="clear:both; height:40px;"></div>
                    
                    <img src="/img/icon_case_factory.png" alt="Manufacturing Use Case" style="height:50px;vertical-align:middle;"/>
                    <span style="font-size:24px;color:#000;">&nbsp;<strong>CASE #5</strong></span>
                    <p><strong>Industrial Manufacturing Facility</strong> is running a three-shift operation with a mix of both union and non-union workforce. HR is having a tough time defining the roles and necessary skills for each area, and capacity planning could really use a hand. Safety is finding it hard to keep track of who has completed what training, or has obtained what certifications. They’d really like to better leverage their ERP system, but it’s a task just to keep up with who's good at what part to establish any type of mentoring, or continued education.</p>

                    <p>SkillResults is introduced and suddenly several issues become assets. Skill reports make capacity planning both easier and more strategic. Power users of the ERP are identified and used as onsite knowledge experts. Safety training and compliance records and renewals are easily managed. Engineering has developed continuing education plans for their department and the idea is starting to spread to other areas. While it all aligns nicely into their quality management system.</p>
